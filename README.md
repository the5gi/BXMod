*Bark* is a mod for the VR game Gorilla Tag. It allows the player to summon a 3D interface into the game that toggles various fun/useful mechanics on and off.

## Features
*Bark* has various modules that can be toggled on and off, including:

### Movement
* `SuperMan` - **[MODIFIED]** This allows the player to fly around. Press the right secondary button (Index: A, Oculus: B) to fly around. Press the left secondary button (Index: A, Oculus: Y) to toggle gravity.
* `Fly Speed Controller` - **[CHANGED]** Allows the player to change their flyspeed with the trigger buttons [Left: Slower, Right: Faster].
* `Grappling Hooks` - **Grab one of the grapple guns** off of your hip holster with **either grip button and then press the trigger to fire**
* `Platforms (Left/Right)` - **Press the grip button** on your controller to create a floating platform in the air that you can stand on. There's a toggle for each hand so that you can disable one if it clashes with another mod's inputs.
* `Speed` - Significantly increases the player's movement speed
### Physics
* `NoClip` - Allows the player to fall through solid objects. Enabling this makes it so that when you press left trigger, you noclip.
* `GripMonke` - **[NAME CHANGE, WAS "no slip" ]** Disables sliding on slippery surfaces, like ice.
* `Slippery Hands` - Makes everything slippery so you can ski anywhere!
### Teleportation
* `Checkpoint` - **Grip the left trigger** to start summoning a holographic banana above your hand. Grip the *right trigger* to warp back to it.
* `Teleport` - **Make a triangle with your thumbs and index fingers and peer through it** to initiate a teleport. Use your head to aim more finely.
### Multiplayer
* `Boxing` - Better known as "punch mod", this allows the player to be punched around by others in the lobby. You can't be punched while touching the ground.
* `Piggyback` - Allows you to ride other players! To mount someone, **have them give you two-thumbs-up**, and then **grip their shoulder**. If they **give you two thumbs down** at any point, you'll stop riding them. *Consent is important!*
* `ESP` - **[NAME CHANGE, WAS "X-RAY" ]** Allows you to see other players through walls.
### Misc (Custom Added, Not Modified)
* `Disconnect` - Leaves your current lobby, if your in one.
* `Invisible` - Press Right trigger to go invisible (aka teleports your body 15000 units away)
* `First Person Camera` - Just toggles first person camera for better screensharing and recordings. I like this feature :p

These modules can be useful for exploring the game world, experimenting with gameplay mechanics, or just having fun with friends. They are **kinda but not really** meant to be used to harass others, which can result in a ban from the game.

## Usage
When you start the game, press the right primary button (Index: B, Oculus: A) and tap your chess with that same hand. This will summon the interface in front of you. To hide the interface, simply grab it and throw it away.

## Installation
To use *BarkX*, you don't need to have [Monke Mod Manager](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/MonkeModManager/releases) installed but it is suggested. Make sure to check Utilla. Once you have installed the mod loader, simply drop the `BarkX-V*version*-PUBLIC.dll` file into your plugins folder.

## Important notes

While *BarkX* is designed to work anywhere, it is important to note that using mods in any form in public lobbies can result in a ban from the game. Use *BarkX* at your own risk.
